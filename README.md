## Good Morning!👋 

# About Me:
**`Web Developer & Computer Scientist`**<br/>
I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer and computer scientist trying to build my own version of the digitial world
one piece of code at a time. I started coding when I was in my Somphore year of Highschool by taking AP Computer Science.
I slowly fell in love with Coding and continuned to study and learn as I went. I'm currently a sophmore attending San Jacinto College majoring in Computer Science, and have been involved in my major.
