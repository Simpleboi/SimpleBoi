## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


# About Me:
**`Web Developer & Computer Scientist`**<br/>
I'm an aspiring full-stack web developer and computer scientist trying to build my own version of the digitial world
one piece of code at a time. I'm currently a sophmore attending San Jacinto College majoring in Computer Science. 
I've won first place at BPA 2022 in Python Programming, and placed 5th at State two months after.
